# Testing



## Manual Testing

* The game has four main buttons linked to four different pages have been tested 
  during the work with the project to ensure they are linked correctly.

*  There is a move counter in the game shows the player how many moves needed to solve the game,
   and there is a time counter also to give a result to the player that how long it took.
   The timer is keep going untill the player clicks the last card.
   The player can't run out of time', can't loose the game, player can competit with his/her selfe to solve the game again
   faster and faster time to time.
     

* Game moves counter tested and checked while game play, increment the numbers after every clicks.

* Pop up message appear on the end of every game level.

* Reset button shuffles the cards any time it has been pressed.

* The main thing of the project is the game, have been tested multiple times
  by family members and my own self on different devices.

## Functionality Testing 

* I used Google Chrome Development Tools to during the whole process to debug, fix, and modify codes.

## Responsive testing

* The project responsiveness tested on the  [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) and the [Responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/) websites and also tested during the project process in Google Chrome tool.

## Performance Testing

- Use Lighthouse tool for testing

### Chrome Light House Screenshot

### End of the game pop up message testing 

* I changed numberOfPairs variable from 8 to 1 during pop up message testing to make 
the testing easier. This technic saved me a lot of time, because I did not have to solve the full game 
every time I tested the pop up window, because I had only 1 pair in my card table.

### Known bug and solving

* The used CSS for flipping card didn't work on Safari Browser and Mozzilla Fire Fox so I had to 
find what CSS can solve my problem.
 
  * The first used Css code

```
.card {
    margin: 5px;
    position: relative;
    transform: scale(1);
    transform-style: preserve-3d;
    transition: transform .5s;
    width: 21%;
    
   
}
.front-card {
    position: relative;
    backface-visibility: hidden;
    transform: rotateY(180deg);
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    
   
    
}
.back-card {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    position: absolute;
    backface-visibility: hidden;
    
}
```
  * Code used to fix the problem 

```
.card {
    margin: 5px;
    position: relative;
    transform: scale(1);
    transform-style: preserve-3d;
    transition: transform .5s;  
    width: 21%;
    background-color: transparent;
   
}
.front-card {
    position: relative;
    backface-visibility: hidden;
    transform: rotateY(180deg);
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;
    
}
.back-card {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    position: absolute;
    backface-visibility: hidden;
    -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;
}

```
   The difference is only the last line in all of the classes, but they 
solved me a big bug in my project.
